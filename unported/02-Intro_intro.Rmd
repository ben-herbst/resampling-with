Introduction
------------

This chapter introduces you to probability and statistics. First come
examples of the kinds of practical problems that this knowledge can
solve for us. Next this Introduction discusses the relationship of
probabilities to decisions. Then comes a discussion of the two general
types of statistics, descriptive and inferential. Following this is a
discussion of the limitations of probability and statistics. And last is
a brief history of statistics. Most important, the chapter describes the
types of problems the book will tackle.

Because the term "statistic" often scares and confuses people--- and
indeed, the term has several sorts of meanings---the chapter includes a
short section on "Types of Statistics." Descriptive statistics are
numbers that summarize the information contained in a group of data.
Inferential statistics are procedures to estimate unknown quantities;
that is, these procedures infer estimates and conclusions based on
whatever descriptive statistics are available.

At the foundation of sound decision-making lies the ability to make
accurate estimates of the probabilities of future events. Probabilistic
problems confront everyone---from the business person considering plant
expansion, to the scientist testing a new wonder drug, to the individual
deciding whether to carry an umbrella to work.

To those interested only in learning resampling statistics, or who have
some previous acquaintance with probability and

statistics, I suggest that you merely glance over this Introduction and
then proceed directly with Chapter 1.

If you want to find out quickly about the resampling method, you might
skim the next few chapters and perhaps skip all the way to Chapter 15.

What kinds of problems shall we solve?
--------------------------------------

These are some examples of the kinds of problems that we can handle with
the methods described in this book:

1.  *You are a doctor* trying to develop a cure for cancer. Currently
    you are working on a medicine labeled CCC. You have data from
    patients to whom medicine CCC was given. You want to judge on the
    basis of those results whether CCC really cures cancer or whether it
    is no better than a sugar pill.

2.  *You are the campaign manager* for the Republicrat candidate for
    President of the United States. You have the results from a recent
    poll taken in New Hampshire. You want to know the chance that your
    candidate would win in New Hampshire if the election were held
    today.

3.  *You are the manager and part owner* of a small construction
    company. You own 20 earthmoving trucks. The chance that any one
    truck will break down on any given day is about one in ten. You want
    to know the chance on a particular day--- tomorrow---that four or
    more of them will be out of action.

4.  *A machine gauged to produce screws* 1.000 inches long produces a
    batch on Tuesday that averaged 1.010 inches. Given the record of
    screws produced by this machine over the past month, we want to know
    whether something about the machine has changed, or whether this
    unusual batch has occurred just by chance.

The core of all these problems, and of the others that we will deal with
in this book, is that you want to know the "chance" or
"probability"---different words for the same idea---that some event will
or will not happen, or that something is true or false. To put it
another way, we want to answer questions about "What is the probability
that\...?", given the body of information that you have in hand.

The question "What is the probability that\...?" is usually not the
ultimate question that interests us at a given moment.

Eventually, a person wants to use the estimated probability to help make
a *decision* concerning some action one might take. These are the kinds
of decisions, related to the questions about probability stated above,
that ultimately we would like to make:

1.  *Should you (the researcher) advise doctors to prescribe medicine
    CCC* for patients, or, should you (the researcher) continue to study
    CCC before releasing it for use? A related matter: should you and
    other research workers feel sufficiently encouraged by the results
    of medicine CCC so that you should continue research in this general
    direction rather than turning to some other promising line of
    research? These are just two of the possible decisions that might be
    influenced by the answer to the question about the probability that
    medicine CCC cures cancer.

2.  *Should you advise the Republicrat presidential candidate to go to
    New Hampshire* to campaign? If the poll tells you conclusively that
    he or she will not win in New Hampshire, you might decide that it is
    not worthwhile investing effort to campaign there. Similarly, if the
    poll tells you conclusively that he or she surely will win in New
    Hampshire, you probably would not want to campaign further there.
    But if the poll is not conclusive in one direction or the other, you
    might choose to invest the effort to campaign in New Hampshire.
    Analysis of the chances of winning in New Hampshire based on the
    poll data can help you make this decision sensibly.

3.  *Should your firm buy more trucks* ? Clearly the answer to this
    question is affected by the probability that a given number of your
    trucks will be out of action on a given day. But of course this
    estimated probability will be only one part of the decision.

4.  *Should we adjust the screw-making machine* after it produces the
    batch of screws averaging 1.010 inches? If its performance has not
    changed, and the unusual batch we observed was just the result of
    random variability, adjusting the machine could render it more
    likely to produce off-target screws in the future.

    The kinds of questions to which we wish to find probabilistic and
    statistical answers may be found throughout the social, biological
    and physical sciences; in business; in politics; in engineering
    (concerning such spectacular projects as the flight to the moon);
    and in most other forms of human endeavor.

    Probabilities and decisions
    ---------------------------

    There are two differences between questions about probabilities and
    the ultimate decision problems:

    1.  Decision problems always involve *evaluation of the
        consequences* ---that is, taking into account the benefits and
        the costs of the consequences---whereas pure questions about
        probabilities are estimated without evaluations of the
        consequences.

    2.  Decision problems often involve a *complex combination* of *sets
        of probabilities and consequences* , together with their
        evaluations. For example: In the case of the contractor's
        trucks, it is clear that there will be a monetary loss to the
        contractor if she makes a commitment to have 16 trucks on a job
        tomorrow and then cannot produce that many trucks. Furthermore,
        the contractor must take into account the further consequence
        that there *may* be a loss of goodwill for the future if she
        fails to meet her obligations tomorrow---and then again there
        *may not* be any such loss; and if there is such loss of
        goodwill it might be a loss worth \$10,000 *or* \$20,000 *or*
        \$30,000. Here the decision problem involves not only the
        probability that there will be fewer than 16 trucks tomorrow but
        also the immediate monetary loss and the subsequent possible
        losses of goodwill, and the valuation of all these consequences.
        The complexity of the contractor's decision problem may be seen
        in the schematic diagram called a "decision tree" shown in
        Figure i-1.

Whether to buy more trucks
--------------------------

Continuing with the decision concerning whether to do more research on
medicine CCC: If you do decide to continue research on CCC, (a) you may,
or (b) you may not, come up with an important general cure within, say,
the next 3 years. If you do come up with such a general cure, of course
it will have very great social benefits. Furthermore, (c) if you decide
not to do further research on CCC now, you can direct your time and that
of other people to research in other directions, with some chance that
the other research will produce a less-general but nevertheless useful
cure for some relatively infrequent forms of cancer. Those three
possibilities have different social benefits. The probability that
medicine CCC really has some curative effect on cancer, as judged by
your prior research, obviously will influence your decision on whether
or not to

do more research on medicine CCC. But that judgment about the
probability is only one part of the overall web of consequences and
evaluations that must be taken into account when making your decision
whether or not to do further research on medicine CCC. Again, the web of
consequences and evaluations for the contractor deciding whether to buy
more trucks is sketched in the decision tree in Figure i-1.

Why does this book limit itself to the specific probability questions
when ultimately we are interested in decisions? A first reason is
division of labor. The more general aspects of the decision-making
process in the face of uncertainty are treated well in other books. This
book's special contribution is its new approach to the crucial process
of estimating the chances that an event will occur.

Second, the specific elements of the overall decision-making process
taught in this book belong to the interrelated subjects of *probability
theory* and *inferential statistics* . Though probabilistic and
inferential-statistical theory ultimately is intended to be part of the
general decision-making process, often only the estimation of
probabilities is done systematically, and the rest of the
decision-making process---for example, the decision

whether or not to proceed with further research on medicine CCC---is
done in informal and unsystematic fashion. This is regrettable, but the
fact that this is standard practice is an additional reason why the
treatment of inferential statistics and probability in this book is
sufficiently complete.

A third reason that this book covers only inferential statistics and not
decision statistics is because most college and university statistics
courses and books are limited to inferential statistics, especially
those courses and books for students in the social sciences.

Types of statistics
-------------------

The term *statistics* sometimes causes confusion and therefore needs
explanation.

A statistic is a *number* . There are two kinds of statistics, *sum-*
*marization* (descriptive) statistics and *probability* statistics. The
most important summarization statistics are the *total* , averages such
as the *mean* and *median* , the *distribution* , the *range* , and
other measures of variation. Such statistics are nothing new to you; you
have been using many of them all your life. Inferential statistics,
which this book deals with, uses descriptive statistics as its input.

Inferential statistics can be used for two purposes: to aid scientific
*understanding* by estimating the probability that a statement is true
or not, and to aid in making *sound decisions* by estimating which
alternative among a range of possibilities is most desirable.

Limitations of probability and statistics
-----------------------------------------

Statistical testing is not equivalent to social-science research, and
research is not the same as statistical testing. Rather, statistical
inference is a handmaiden of research, often but not always necessary in
the research process.

A working knowledge of the basic ideas of statistics, especially the
elements of probability, is unsurpassed in its general value to everyone
in a modern society. Statistics and probability help clarify one's
thinking and improve one's capacity to deal with practical problems and
to understand the world. To be efficient, a social scientist or
decision-maker is almost certain to need statistics and probability.

On the other hand, important research and top-notch decision-making have
been done by people with absolutely no formal knowledge of statistics.
And a limited study of statistics sometimes befuddles students into
thinking that statistical principles are guides to research design and
analysis. This mistaken belief only inhibits the exercise of sound
research thinking. Kinsey long ago put it this way:

However satisfactory the standard deviations may be, no statistical
treatment can put validity into generalizations which are based on data
that were not reasonably accurate and complete to begin with. It is
unfortunate that academic departments so often offer courses on the
statistical manipulation of human material to students who have little
understanding of the problems involved in securing the original data.
...When training in these things replaces or at least precedes some of
the college courses on the mathematical treatment of data, we shall come
nearer to having a science of human behavior. (Kinsey et al., 1948, p.
35).

In much---even most---research in social and physical sciences,
statistical testing is not necessary. Where there are large differences
between different sorts of circumstances---for example, if a new
medicine cures 90 patients out of 100 and the old medicine cures only 10
patients out of 100---we do not need refined statistical tests to tell
us whether or not the new medicine really has an effect. And the best
research is that which shows large differences, because it is the large
effects that matter. If the researcher finds that s/he must use refined
statistical tests to reveal whether there are differences, this
sometimes means that the differences do not matter much.

To repeat, then, some or even much research---especially in the physical
and biological sciences---does not need the kind of statistical
manipulation that will be described in this book. But most decision
problems *do* need the kind of probabilistic and statistical input that
is described in this book.

Another matter: If the raw data are of poor quality, probabilistic and
statistical manipulation cannot be very useful. In the example of the
contractor and her trucks, if the contractor's estimate that a given
truck has a one-in-ten chance of being out-of-order on a given day is
very inaccurate, then our calculation of the probability that four or
more trucks will be out of order on a given day will not be helpful, and
may be misleading. To put it another way, one cannot make bread without
flour, yeast, and water. And good raw data are the flour, yeast and
water necessary to get an accurate estimate of a probabil-

ity. The most refined statistical and probabilistic manipulations are
useless if the input data are poor---the result of unrepresentative
samples, uncontrolled experiments, inaccurate measurement, and the host
of other ways that informationgathering can go wrong. (See Simon and
Burstein, 1985, for a catalog of the obstacles to obtaining good data.)
Therefore, we should constantly direct our attention to ensuring that
the data upon which we base our calculations are the best it is possible
to obtain.
