Brief history of the resampling method
--------------------------------------

This book describes a revolutionary---but now fullyaccepted---approach
to probability and statistics. Monte Carlo resampling simulation takes
the mumbo-jumbo out of statistics and enables even beginning students to
understand completely everything that is done.

Before we go further, let's make the discussion more concrete with an
example. Ask a class: What are the chances that three of a family's
first four children will be girls? After various entertaining class
suggestions about procreating four babies, or surveying families with
four children, someone in the group always suggests flipping a coin.
This leads to valuable student discussion about whether the probability
of a girl is exactly half (there are about 105 males born for each 100
females), whether .5 is a satisfactory approximation, whether four coins
flipped once give the same answer as one coin flipped four times, and so
on. Soon the class decides to take actual samples of coin flips. And
students see that this method quickly arrives at estimates that are
accurate enough for most purposes. Discussion of what is "accurate
enough" also comes up, and that discussion is valuable, too.

The Monte Carlo method itself is not new. Near the end of World War II,
a group of physicists at the Rand Corp. began to use random-number
simulations to study processes too complex to handle with formulas. The
name "Monte Carlo" came from the analogy to the gambling houses on the
French Riviera. The application of Monte Carlo methods in *teaching*
statistics also is not new. Simulations have often been used to
illustrate basic concepts. What *is* new and radical is using Monte
Carlo methods routinely as problem-solving tools for everyday problems
in probability and statistics.

From here on, the related term *resampling* will be used throughout the
book. Resampling refers to the use of the observed data or of a data
generating mechanism (such as a die) to produce new hypothetical
samples, the results of which can then be analyzed. The term
*computer-intensive methods* also is frequently used to refer to
techniques such as these.

The history of resampling is as follows: In the mid-1960's, I noticed
that most graduate students---among them many who had had several
advanced courses in statistics---were unable to apply statistical
methods correctly in their social science research. I sympathized with
them. Even many experts are unable to understand intuitively the formal
mathematical approach to the subject. Clearly, we need a method free of
the formulas that bewilder almost everyone.

The solution is as follows: Beneath the logic of a statistical inference
there necessarily lies a physical process. The resampling methods
described in this book allow us to work directly with the underlying
physical model by simulating it, rather than describing it with
formulae. This general insight is also the heart of the specific
technique Bradley Efron felicitously labeled 'the bootstrap' (Efron,
1982), a device I introduced in 1969 that is now the most commonly used,
and best known, resampling method.

The resampling approach was first tried with graduate students in 1966,
and it worked exceedingly well. Next, under the auspices of the father
of the "new math," Max Beberman, I "taught" the method to a class of
high school seniors in 1967. The word "taught" is in quotation marks
because the pedagogical essence of the resampling approach is that the
students discover the method for themselves with a minimum of explicit
instruction from the teacher.

The first classes were a success and the results were published in 1969.
Three PhD experiments were then conducted under Kenneth Travers'
supervision, and they all showed overwhelming superiority for the
resampling method (Simon, Atkinson, and Shevokas, 1976). Subsequent
research has confirmed this success.

The method was first presented at some length in the 1969 edition of my
book *Basic Research Methods in Social Science* (third edition with Paul
Burstein, 1985).

For some years, the resampling method failed to ignite interest among
statisticians. While many factors (including the accumulated
intellectual and emotional investment in existing methods) impede the
adoption of any new technique, the lack of readily available computing
power and tools was an obstacle. (The advent of the personal computer in
the 1980s changed that, of course.)

Then in the late 1970s, Efron began to publish formal analyses of the
bootstrap---an important resampling application. Interest among
statisticians has exploded since then, in conjunction with the
availability of easy, fast, and inexpensive computer simulations. The
bootstrap has been the most widely used, but across-the-board
application of computer intensive methods now seems at hand. As Noreen
(1989) noted, "there is a computer-intensive alternative to just about
every conventional parametric and nonparametric test." And the bootstrap
method has now been hailed by an official *American Statistical
Association* volume as the only "great breakthrough" in statistics since
1970 (Kotz and Johnson, 1992).

It seems appropriate now to offer the resampling method as the technique
of choice for beginning students as well as for the advanced
practitioners who have been exploring and applying the method.

An early difficulty with the method had been that flipping coins and
using a random-number table to simulate the resampling trials are
laborious. Therefore, in 1973 Dan Weidenfeld and I developed the
computer language called RESAMPLING STATS (earlier called SIMPLE STATS).
Each command in the language executes an operation that simulates what
the hand does when working with cards or dice. For example, instead of
flipping coins in the problem described above, we first give the command
GENERATE 4 1,2 A, which tells the computer to choose four '1s' and '2s'
randomly and store the result in location A. Then we command COUNT a = 1
K, which tells the computer to count the number of '1s' (girls) that
were selected in the previous operation and put the result in "K." Next
we place the command REPEAT before the coin-flipping operations; this
instructs the computer to perform (say) a thousand trials. After
commanding END to complete the 1000 repetitions, we command COUNT z = 3
J, which tells the computer to count the number of trials where the
outcome is three girls. That's all it takes to obtain the answer we
seek.

The RESAMPLING STATS computer program is a simple language requiring
absolutely no experience with computers. Yet it also provides a painless
introduction to the power of computers. RESAMPLING STATS is available
for both the

MacIntosh and Windows computers.

Though the term "computer-intensive methods" is nowadays used to
describe the techniques elaborated here, this book can be read either
with or without the accompanying use of the computer. However, as a
practical matter, users of these methods are unlikely to be content with
manual simulations if a quick and simple computer-program alternative
such as RESAMPLING STATS is available.

The ultimate test of the resampling method is how well you, the reader,
learn it and like it. But knowing about the experiences of others may
help beginners as well as experienced statisticians approach the scary
subject of statistics with a good attitude. Students as early as junior
high school, taught by a variety of instructors and in other languages
as well as English, have---in a matter of 6 or 12 short hours---learned
how to handle problems that students taught conventionally do not learn
until advanced university courses. And several controlled experimental
studies show that, on average, students who learn this method are more
likely to arrive at correct solutions than are students who are taught
conventional methods.

Best of all, the experiments comparing the resampling method against
conventional methods show that students *enjoy* learning statistics and
probability this way, and they don't suffer statistics panic. This
experience contrasts sharply with the reactions of students learning by
conventional methods. (This is true even when the same teachers teach
both methods as part of an experiment.)

A public offer: The intellectual history of probability and statistics
began with gambling games and betting. Therefore, perhaps a lighthearted
but very serious offer would not seem inappropriate here: I hereby
publicly offer to stake \$5,000 in a contest against any teacher of
conventional statistics, with the winner to be decided by whose students
get the larger number of simple and complex numerical problems correct,
when teaching similar groups of students for a limited number of class
hours---say, six or ten. And if I should win, as I am confident that I
will, I will contribute the winnings to the effort to promulgate this
teaching method. (Here it should be noted that I am far from being the
world's most skillful or charming teacher. It is the subject matter that
does the job, not the teacher's excellence.) This offer has been in
print for many years now, but no one has accepted it.

The early chapters of the book contain considerable discussion of the
resampling method, and of ways to teach it. This material is intended
mainly for the instructor; because the method is new and revolutionary,
many instructors appreciate this guidance. But this didactic material is
also intended to help the student get actively involved in the learning
process rather than just sitting like a baby bird with its beak open
waiting for the mother bird to drop morsels into its mouth. You may skip
this didactic material, of course, and I hope that it does not get in
your way. But all things considered, I decided it was better to include
this material early on rather than to put it in the back or in a
separate publication where it might be overlooked.

Brief history of statistics
---------------------------

In ancient times, mathematics developed from the needs of governments
and rich men to number armies, flocks, and especially to count the
taxpayers and their possessions. Up until the beginning of the 20th
century, the term *statistic* meant the number of something---soldiers,
births, taxes, or what-have-you. In many cases, the term *statistic*
still means the number of something; the most important statistics for
the United States are in the *Statistical Abstract of the United States*
. These numbers are now known as descriptive statistics. This book will
not deal at all with the making or interpretation of descriptive
statistics, because the topic is handled very well in most conventional
statistics texts.

Another stream of thought entered the field of probability and
statistics in the 17th century by way of gambling in France. Throughout
history people had learned about the odds in gambling games by repeated
plays of the game. But in the year 1654, the French nobleman Chevalier
de Mere asked the great mathematician and philosopher Pascal to help him
develop correct odds for some gambling games. Pascal, the famous Fermat,
and others went on to develop modern probability theory.

Later these two streams of thought came together. Researchers wanted to
know how accurate their descriptive statistics were---not only the
descriptive statistics originating from sample surveys, but also the
numbers arising from experiments. Statisticians began to apply the
theory of probability to the accuracy of the data arising from sample
surveys and experiments, and that became the theory of *inferential
statistics* .

Here we find a guidepost: probability theory and statistics are relevant
whenever there is uncertainty about events occurring in the world, or in
the numbers describing those events.

Later, probability theory was also applied to another context in which
there is uncertainty---decision-making situations. Descriptive
statistics like those gathered by insurance companies---for example, the
number of people per thousand in each age bracket who die in a five-year
period---have been used for a long time in making decisions such as how
much to charge for insurance policies. But in the modern probabilistic
theory of decision-making in business, politics and war, the emphasis is
different; in such situations the emphasis is on methods of *combining*
estimates of probabilities that depend upon each other in complicated
ways in order to arrive at the best decision. This is a return to the
gambling origins of probability and statistics. In contrast, in standard
insurance situations (not including war insurance or insurance on a
dancer's legs) the probabilities can be estimated with good precision
without complex calculation, on the basis of a great many observations,
and the main statistical task is gathering the information. In business
and political decision-making situations, however, one often works with
probabilities based on very limited information---often little better
than guesses. There the task is how best to combine these guesses about
various probabilities into an overall probability estimate.

Estimating probabilities with conventional mathematical methods is often
so complex that the process scares many people. And properly so, because
its difficulty leads to errors. The statistics profession worries
greatly about the widespread use of conventional tests whose foundations
are poorly understood. The wide availability of statistical computer
packages that can easily perform these tests with a single command,
regardless of whether the user understands what is going on or whether
the test is appropriate, has exacerbated this problem. This led John
Tukey to turn the field toward descriptive statistics with his
techniques of "exploratory data analysis" (Tukey, 1977). These
descriptive methods are well described in many texts.

Probabilistic analysis also is crucial, however. Judgments about whether
the government should allow a new medicine on the market, or whether an
operator should adjust a screw machine, require more than eyeball
inspection of data to assess the chance variability. But until now the
teaching of probabilistic statistics, with its abstruse structure of
mathematical formulas, mysterious tables of calculations, and
restrictive assumptions concerning data distributions---all of which
separate the student from the actual data or physical process under
consideration---have been an insurmountable obstacle to intuitive
understanding.

Now, however, the resampling method enables researchers and
decision-makers in all walks of life to obtain the benefits of
statistics and predictability without the shortcomings of conventional
methods, free of mathematical formulas and restrictive assumptions.
Resampling's repeated experimental trials on the computer enable the
data (or a data-generating mechanism representing a hypothesis) to
express their own properties, without difficult and misleading
assumptions.

A look ahead at the book
------------------------

Now for a brief look ahead at the book. The Introduction and Chapter 1
introduce you to probability and statistics, and to the resampling
method of estimating the probabilities of events. If you have studied
statistics before, you can skip these chapters. Chapters 2 and 3 briefly
discuss some of the basic concepts which statisticians use in their
thinking. You might choose to move right on to the method itself
starting in Chapter 4, and return later to read about these concepts
after you have experienced them in practice. Chapters 4 through 10 get
to work applying the Monte Carlo method to simple problems in estimating
the probability of compound events, such as the chance of having three
girls in four children. Chapter 11 begins the study of statistical
inference.

So---good luck. I hope that you enjoy the book and profit from it.
