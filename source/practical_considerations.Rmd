## Follow good software practices

This might appear as an unusual topic for a book on statistics. However, it does emphasize resampling methods. And that
is all about coding. Anyway, you will become so much more marketable if you learn the basics of solid software practices.
We don't have the space to do it here but we do want to stress its importance. Always keep in mind the following:

1. Use versioning control; we recommend using git. If you regularly push to the git repo this will protect you from
   accidental software loss. It makes is also eay to share your code. You want other people to use your code, it make you
   so much more useful!
2. Ask someone else to critically review your code. Even better if you work in an environment where there is a formal
   system of code review.
3. Read other people's code. You will learn a lot.
4. Always add tests for your code. This means that you run your code on small examples for which you know the answer. Every
   time you make changes to your code you can check that no unwanted side effects occurred.
5. Even better if you start you coding exercise with a small example for which you know the answer. This is known as
   test-driven and we do this all the time.
6. Python has several formal testing environments that help you write tests. We recommend `pytest`.
7. Always be critical of yourself. You will run into bugs and make errors. This is inevitable and you should learn how
   to recognise non-obvious errors. Are the results what you expect, are they reasonable? This of everything you
   possibly can to find fault with the output of your system.
8. Always be critical of yourself. Know that you can and will make mistakes. That is no shame; being sloppy and not following
   good practices, is.
