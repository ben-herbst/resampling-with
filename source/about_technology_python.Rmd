## About the technology

This chapter introduces you to the technology we will use throughout the book.  By *technology*, we mean two things:

* The Python programming language, along with some important add-on libraries
  for data analysis.
* The Jupyter notebook system for running and editing Python code within a web
  interface.

The chapter introduces Python and its libraries, and then gives an example to
introduce Python and the Jupyter Notebook.  If you have not used Python
before, the example notebook will get you started.  The example also shows how
we will be using notebooks through the rest of the book.

## Python and packages

This version of the book uses the *Python* [^python] programming language to
implement resampling algorithms.

Python is a programming language that can be used for many tasks.  It is a
popular language for teaching, but is also used widely in industry and
academia.  It is one of the most widely used programming languages in the
world.

For many of the initial examples, we will also be using the *Numpy* [^numpy]
package for Python. A *package* is a library of Python code and data.  Numpy
is a package that makes it easier to work with sequences of data values, such
as sequences of numbers.  These are typical in probability and statistics.

We will also be using the *Matplotlib* [^matplotlib] package. This is the main
Python library for producing plots, such as bar charts, histograms, and
scatter plots.  See the rest of the book for more details on these plots.

Later on, we will use more specialized libraries for data manipulation and
analysis.  *Pandas* [^pandas] is the standard Python package for loading data
files and working with data tables.  *Scipy* [^scipy] is a package that houses
a wide range of numerical routines, including some simple statistical methods.
The *Statsmodels* [^statsmodels] package has code for many more statistical
procedures. We will often find ourselves comparing the results of our own
resampling algorithms to those in Scipy and Statsmodels.

## The environment {-}

Many of the chapters have sections with code for you to run, and experiment
with. These sections contain *Jupyter Notebook* [^jupyter-nb].  We mark the
start of each notebook in the text with a note and link heading like the one
you see below. In the web edition of this book, you can click on the
*Download* link in this header to download the section as a notebook. You can
also click on the *Interact* link in this header to open the notebook on a
cloud computer.  This allows you to interact with the notebook on the cloud
computer.  You can run the code, and experiment by making changes.

In the print version of the book, we point you to the web version, to get the
links.

At the end of this chapter, we give explain how to run these notebooks on your
own computer.  We start with an example notebook; you might want to run this on the cloud to get started.

## Getting started with the notebook

The next section contains a notebook called "Billie's Bill".  If you are
looking at the web edition, you will see links to interact with this notebook
in the cloud, or download it to your computer.

::: {.notebook name="billies_bill" title="Billie's Bill"}

The text in this notebook section assumes you have opened the page as an
interactive notebook, on your own computer, or one of the Jupyter web
interfaces.

A notebook can contain blocks of text — like this one — as well as code, and
the results from running the code.

Jupyter Notebooks are made up of *cells*.  This is a cell with text — a text
cell.

A text cell can have formatting, such as links.

For example, see [Notebook basics](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Notebook%20Basics.html) for another introduction to the notebook interface.

See the linked page for an introduction to the notebook Dashboard, where you
can open notebooks from a file listing, or create new ones.

If you are in the notebook interface (rather than reading this in the
textbook), you will see the Jupyter Menu near the top of the page, with
headings "File", "Edit" and so on.

Underneath that, by default, you may see a row of icons - the "Toolbar".

In the toolbar, you may see icons to run the current cell, among others.

Here is a picture, for those of you reading this in textbook form.

![](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/_images/menubar_toolbar.png)

To move from one cell to the next, you can click the run icon in the toolbar, but it is more efficient to press the Shift key, and press Enter (with Shift still held down).  We will write this as Shift-Enter.


In this notebook we will be using Python to solve one of those difficult problems in life — working out the bill in a restaurant.


## The meal in question


Alex and Billie are at a restaurant, getting ready to order. They do not have
much money, so they are calculating the expected bill before they order.

Alex is thinking of having the fish for £10.50, and Billie is leaning towards
the chicken, at £9.25.  First they calculate their combined bill.

The cell below is a *code* cell.  It contains the Python code to calculate the
total bill. Press Shift-Enter in the cell below, to see the total:

```{python}
10.50 + 9.25
```

The contents of cell above is Python code.  As you would predict, Python
understands numbers like `10.50`, and it understands `+` between the numbers
as an instruction to add the numbers.

When you press Shift-Enter, Python makes its own representation of `10.50`, and its own representation of `9.25`, and then runs the *addition* operation on these two, which results in Python's representation of `19.75`.

Finally, Python sends back the `19.75`.  The notebook detects that Python sent back a value, and shows it to us.

This is exactly what a calculator would do.


## Comments

Unlike a calculator, we can also put notes next to our calculations, to remind us what they are for.   One way of doing this is to use a "comment".  You have already seen comments in the previous chapter.

A comment is some text that the computer will ignore.  In Python, you can make a comment by starting a line with the `#` (hash) character.  For example, the next cell is a code cell, but when you run it, it does not show any result.  In this case, that is because the computer sees the `#` at the beginning of the line, and then ignores the rest.

```{python}
# This bit of text is for me to read, and the computer to ignore.
```

Many of the code cells you see will have comments in them, to explain what the code is doing.

Practice writing comments for your own code.  It is a very good habit to get
into.  You will find that experienced programmers write many comments on their
code.  They do not do this to show off, but because they have a lot of
experience in reading code, and they know that comments make it much easier to
read and understand code.


## More calculations

Let us continue with the struggle that Alex and Billie are having with their
bill.

They realize that they will also need to pay a tip.

They think it would be reasonable to leave a 15% tip.  Now they need to
multiply their total bill by 0.15, to get the tip.  The bill is about £20, so
they know that the tip will be about £3.

In Python, as for your calculator, `*` means multiplication.

What about this, for the correct calculation?

```{python}
# The tip - with a mistake.
10.50 + 9.25 * 0.15
```

Oh dear, no, that isn't doing the right calculation.

Python follows the normal rules of *precedence* with calculations. These rules
tell us to do multiplication before addition.

See <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations> for more detail on the standard rules.

In the case above the rules tell Python to first calculate `9.25 * 0.15` (to
get `1.3875`) and then to add the result to `10.50`, giving `11.8875`.

We need to tell Python we want it to do the *addition* and *then* the
multiplication.  We do this with round brackets (parentheses):

```{python}
# The bill plus tip - mistake fixed.
(10.50 + 9.25) * 0.15
```

For those of you working on this section in a notebook, it is now your turn.
Calculate Alex and Billie's bill including the tip:

```{python}
# The bill, including the tip
# Type your code below.
```

Alex and Billie are each going to pay half the bill.   Calculate half the bill
(where the bill is the total bill including the tip):

```{python}
# Half the total bill, including the tip
# Type your code below.
```

Alex is planning to drink three cherry colas, each at £1.50.   Billie is going
to have a glass of wine, at £3.50.  Now what is their combined bill, plus tip?

```{python}
# The total bill, including drinks, and the tip.
# Type your code below.
```

## Running the code on your own computer {-}

Many people, including your humble authors, like to be able to run examples on
our own computers.  This section explains how you can set up to run the
notebooks on your own computer.

You will need to install the Python language on your computer, and then install the following packages:

* Numpy
* Matplotlib - for plots
* Scipy - a collection of modules for scientific computing;
* Pandas - for loading, saving and manipulating data tables;
* Statsmodels - for traditional statistical analysis.
* Jupyter - to run the Jupyter Notebook on your own computer.

One easy way to all install all these packages on Windows, Mac or Linux, is to
use the *Anaconda Python distribution* [^anaconda_distro].  Anaconda provides
a single installer that will install Python and all the packages above, by
default.

Another method is to install Python from the Python website [^python].  Then use the *Pip* [^pip] installer to install the packages you need.

To use Pip, start a terminal (Start key, "cmd" in Windows, Command key and space then "Terminal" on Mac), and then, at the prompt, type:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy pandas statsmodels jupyter
```

Now you should be able to start the Jupyter notebook application.  Open the
notebook you downloaded for the chapter; you now be able to run the code on
your own computer, and experiment by making changes.
