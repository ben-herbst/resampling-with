NUMBERS 1,10 a
' An array of 10 males.
NUMBERS 1,10 b
' An identical array of 10 females—the pair for each of the males.
REPEAT 1000
' Do the experiment 1000 times.
SHUFFLE b c
' Shuffle the females.
SUBTRACT a c d
' This operation pairs each shuffled female with a male and sub- tracts. If it is an original pairing (1/1, 2/2, etc.), the result will be a 0. The number of 0’s indicates how many of the 10 males got paired up again with their original partner.
COUNT d =0 e
' Count the number of 0’s and put the result in e.
SCORE e z
' Keep track of each trial result.
END
' End the trial, go back and repeat until all 1000 are complete.
HISTOGRAM z
' Produce a histogram of the results.
COUNT z >= 4 k
' Determine how many trials had 4 or more males being matched with their partner after the shuffling. (Note that this is the same as the number of females being matched with their original partner.)
DIVIDE k 1000 kk
' Convert to a proportion.
PRINT kk
' Print the result.
