NUMBERS 1,24 a
' Constitute the set of the weight gain rank orders. A is now a vector
' consisting of the numbers 1 â€” 24, in that order.
REPEAT 1000
    ' Do the following experiment 1000 times.
    SHUFFLE a b
    ' Shuffle the ranks of the weight gains, put the shuffled ranks in b.
    TAKE b 1,12 c
    ' Take the first 12 ranks, put them in c
    COUNT c <= 12 d
    ' Determine how many of these randomly selected 12 ranks are less than
    ' 12 (i.e. 1-12), put that result in d.
    SCORE d z
    ' Keep track of each trial result in z.
END
' End one experiment, go back and repeat until 1000 trials are
' complete.
HISTOGRAM z
' Produce a histogram of the trial results.
