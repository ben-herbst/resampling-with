NUMBERS (97 94 93 90 87 86 86 85 81 76) a
' Record athletic scores, highest to lowest.
NUMBERS (114 120 107 113 118 101 109 110 100 99) b
' Record corresponding IQ scores for those students.
MULTIPLY a b c
' Multiply the two sets of scores together.
SUM c d
' Sum the results â€” the "observed value."
REPEAT 1000
    ' Do 1000 experiments.
    SHUFFLE a e
    ' Shuffle the athletic scores so we can pair them against IQ scores.
    MULTIPLY e b f
    ' Multiply the shuffled athletic scores by the I.Q. scores. (Note that we
    ' could shuffle the I.Q. scores too but it would not achieve any greater
    ' randomization.)
    SUM f j
    ' Sum the randomized multiplications.
    SUBTRACT d j k
    ' Subtract the sum from the sum of the "observed" multiplication.
    SCORE k z
    ' Keep track of the result in z.
END
' End one trial, go back and repeat until 1000 trials are complete.
HISTOGRAM z
' Obtain a histogram of the trial results.
